# Food2Fork Sample - Example Refactor MVP, Retrofit2, Dagger2, Unitest, Mockito.

# Setup

- Get your Food2Fork API key from [http://food2fork.com/about/api]

- Create a keystore.properties file with the following content (including the quotes) at root directory:
  FOOD2FORK_API_KEY="YOUR API KEY"
  
- Switch branch to see refactor code.

# Any ideas are appreciated
